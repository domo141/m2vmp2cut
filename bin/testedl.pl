# this program creates test.edl which can be used with mplayer
# to post-test cuts (and how those behave). naturally, it cannot
# detect if there were more stuff to be cut out (or in).
# this requires that every part is at least 1 minute long (1500 frames)

# the "wide" clip areas are for mpg compatibility with the first mplayer
# i tried this (still 40 sec was not enough for the last, w/ 60 last part
# worked. with .mkv files this seems to work better (better seek info in
# container)
