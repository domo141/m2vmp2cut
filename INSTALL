This program can be run without installing, just
enter `./m2vmp2cut <options>'

Or use something like
	'make install PREFIX=/usr/local PJXJAR=/path/to/ProjectX.jar'
to install this software.

(ProjectX is available at project-x.sourceforge.net)

Mjpegtools (mplex and mpeg2enc) is needed in some parts of the usage;
install it separately unless already there.
