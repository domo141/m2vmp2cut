ANNOUNCE for m2vmp2cut

This is stable release of m2vmp2cut -- frame accurate (currently PAL)
mpeg2 video (m2v file) with accompanied mp2 audio (mp2 file) cutter.

Some frames around cutpoints are re-encoded using mpeg2enc;
rest picture data is written untouched to the output.

Audio is cut from separate mp2 file at positions that keep a/v sync
as good as possible (maximum sync difference is around 10-15 milliseconds).

Tomi Ollila, too Ã¤t iki fi
