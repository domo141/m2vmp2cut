ANNOUNCE for m2vmp2cut 0.76

This is stable release of m2vmp2cut -- frame accurate (currently PAL)
mpeg2 video (m2v file) with accompanied mp2 audio (mp2 file) cutter.

Some frames around cutpoints are re-encoded using mpeg2enc;
rest picture data is written untouched to the output.

Audio is cut from separate mp2 file at positions that keep a/v sync
as good as possible (maximum sync difference is around 10-15 milliseconds).

This software is available currently at http://www.iki.fi/too/sw/m2vmp2cut/
and is licensed under GNU Public License (GPL).

	Tuned file/directory argument position on m2vmp2cut command (again).

	Binaries wavgraph and warpxpointer are installed.
	Audio sync fixed in cutpoint test functionality.

Changes since 0.65 (r2101, Faux pas):

	(silent) spot for cutpoint.

Changes since 0.56 (r290, Fifty-Sixty):
