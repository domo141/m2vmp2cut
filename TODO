Well, all other stuff than this has been used since first version (2004-09),
Probability that these will be addressed is pretty low...

Better docs (in rst format).

Better name.

Handling of spumux-xml -formatted subtitle files.

---

AC3 audio.

NTSC support (Low in my priority, but patches welcome).

Going into Gops to see whether less frames needs to be encoded -- like
scene endpoints with P-frames and scene startpoint with I-frames.
But I don't see it a big problem to encode a few frames even not
absolutely necessary.


Cleaning up the code.


Probably many others.
