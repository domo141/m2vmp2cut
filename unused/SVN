1) How did I setup subversion for this project (and everything else I had 
	in my personal CVS repository).

At 2004/09/08 (Wed) I converted my personal CVS repository to subversion.
By then I'd been using subversion for 5 months and I were quite 
comfortable with it -- in fact I am not at all confortable with CVS anymore
(I can use it, and hack the server side to get some things done, but ...).

The conversion was done the following way:

repository-host $ cd ~
repository-host $ mkdir .repos
repository-host $ svnadmin create .repos/mySVN
repository-host $ svn co file://$HOME/.repos/mySVN
Checked out revision 0.
repository-host $ mkdir mySVN/main
repository-host $ svn add mySVN/main
A         mySVN/main
repository-host $ svn commit -m 'Created main...' mySVN
Adding         mySVN/main

Committed revision 1.

(Repository created, main dir created -- now I just copy my old CVS rep there)

repository-host $ cd myCVS
repository-host $ cvs up
repository-host $ cvs up 2>/dev/null
repository-host $ ### removed junk files ###
repository-host $ cd ..
repository-host $ cp -a myCVS/* mySVN/main # note linux syntax: alternative -pR
repository-host $ cd mySVN/main
repository-host $ rm -rf **/CVS # note: zsh syntax...
repository-host $ rm -rf CVSROOT
repository-host $ find . -type d  # kreit, no extra dirs there...
repository-host $ svn add *
... many lines of output ...
repository-host $ svn commit -m 'Initial fill of subversion repository.'
... many lines of output ...
Committed revision 2.

(There is some cvs2svn scripts if one wants to have old commit messages...)

other-host $ svn co svn+ssh://repository-host/<home>/.repos/mySVN
too@repository-host's password:
A  mySVN/main
... many other lines of output ...
Checked out revision 2.

third-host: $ svn co svn+fsh://repository-host/<home>/.repos/mySVN
svn: Undefined tunnel scheme 'fsh'
zsh: exit 1     svn co svn+fsh://repository-host/<home>/.repos/mySVN

(AUTS !... another thing I would like is that ~ (home) could be used there...
... OK, [tunnel] info can be added for fsh, and SVN_SSH=fsh works also)

other-host $ cd mySVN/main/projects
other-host $ mkdir m2vmp2cut
other-host $ cp -a ~/projects/m2vmp2cut/* m2vmp2cut
other-host $ svn add m2vmp2cut
other-host $ svn revert -R m2vmp2cut
other-host $ cd m2vmp2cut
other-host $ ### deleted junk ###
other-host $ cd ..
other-host $ svn add m2vmp2cut
other-host $ svn commit -m 'Added m2vmp2cut to projects.'
too@repository-host's password:
Adding projects/m2vmp2cut
... many other lines of output ...
Transmitting file data ................
Committed revision 3.

(Good, it looks it always asks me for password, anyway, it is good to
 uncomment line `# store-auth-creds = no' in ~/.subversion/config
 in order to avoid caching your password (in cleartext) when accessing
 some subversion (http:// accessed only?) repositories.)
